  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p class="hidden delay1">It all began with a simple love for coffee not just drinking it, but understanding it. What makes one cup comforting and another unforgettable? That curiosity turned into a hobby, and over time, that hobby turned into something much bigger: a small caf√©, built from scratch with passion and persistence.</p>

  <p class="hidden delay2">Every day since has been a learning experience. From figuring out how to steam milk just right, to managing supplies, designing menus, handling customers, and even scrubbing floors after closing ‚Äî it‚Äôs all part of the journey. Running a caf√© isn‚Äôt glamorous, but it‚Äôs real. It‚Äôs hands-on, it‚Äôs tiring, and it‚Äôs incredibly fulfilling.</p>

  <p class="hidden delay3">Beyond the coffee, there's a deeper reason behind everything I do ‚Äî the joy of creating a space where people feel comfortable, welcome, and seen. A place that feels familiar, even on your first visit. Whether it's a regular who orders the same thing every morning, or someone discovering their new favorite drink, those small connections matter.</p>

  <p class="hidden delay4"> This site is more than just a portfolio ‚Äî it's a reflection of that journey. A glimpse into the hustle behind the scenes, the lessons learned (often the hard way), and the ongoing dream of turning a passion into something that leaves a mark. I enjoy exploring web design, branding, and entrepreneurship. My goal is not just to serve coffee, but to build a brand and experience people remember. So if you‚Äôve found yourself here, welcome ‚Äî and I hope something here inspires you to keep building what you love, one small step at a time.</p>
